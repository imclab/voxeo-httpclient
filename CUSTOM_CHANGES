The original source was modified as follows:

1. Moved the entire source into a "com.innovation" package.

2. Added a PURGE method.

3. Added a timeout directly to the socket which seems more reliable than the original method.

All other files (0COPYRIGHT, 0README, 'alt' directory, etc) have been left intact.
